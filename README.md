# Alteryx to Azure Data Factory Instruction Generator

**Generated by ChatGPT**

---

## Overview

This repository contains a **Streamlit-based internal utility** that translates **Alteryx workflows (`.yxmd`)** into **step-by-step Azure Data Factory (ADF) GUI instructions** using an OpenAI large language model.

The tool is intended to support **data engineers migrating from Alteryx to Azure Data Factory**, enabling them to rebuild pipelines using **ADF Mapping Data Flows** without writing code.

The application is deliberately implemented in a **simple, minimally abstracted style** to ensure ease of understanding, debugging, and rapid modification by future developers.

## Key Features

- 📤 Upload Alteryx workflow files (`.yxmd`)
- 🧠 Generate **detailed, step-by-step ADF GUI instructions**
- 💬 Chat interface for workflow-specific follow-up questions
- 📄 One-click **PDF export** of generated instructions
- 🏷️ PDF filename automatically derived from the Alteryx workflow name
- 🔐 OpenAI API key entered via UI (no environment variable dependency)

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Streamlit** – Web UI framework
- **OpenAI Python SDK (>= 1.0.0)** – LLM access
- **reportlab** – PDF generation
- **OpenAI model**: `gpt-4.1-mini` (default, configurable)

## Why the Code Is Intentionally “Messy”

This project is a **proof-of-concept / internal enablement tool**, not a production system.

Design decisions were intentional:
- Single-file application (`app.py`)
- No classes or layered architecture
- Inline prompt construction
- UI-based API key input
- Minimal retry and error handling
- No persistence layer

This ensures the code is:
- Easy to read
- Easy to debug
- Easy to extend by analysts or junior engineers

**Do not refactor unless productizing.**
